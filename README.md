# Email username for both cock.li and proton mail

To install and just run for a CLI just run

    python email-gen.py 
    

For HTML just simply do these steps:

    python -m venv venv

</br>

    source venv/bin/activate

</br>

    pip install flask

after that run

    python app.py

For a HTML page


From there you should be given a list of domains to choose from or if you want you can choose a random one from cock.li

when executed it will display a username and password for both proton and cock.li

You will still need to solve a captcha for cock.li if you decide to use this.

exmaple:

    Cock.li email: sophiaadamss67@cock.li | Password: IH'`%Yx<EIinp[\+.(P/Kka\#[qyE8y|3%dQ*BmOM1|XnKG-W:)"NURwgHBf*pGl
    ProtonMail email: williamadamsc9tb@proton.me | Password: z3N9iMv^*@qj]"RG"/blelmvO"2{+,\E'dxv!T,*VwQB"KP}tmEP&UWKkgAAbwgh
